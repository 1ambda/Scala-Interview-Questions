# General Questions

Q. What did you learn yesterday / this week?

> I analyzed cats implementation while preparing this interview. 
I think cats has simple implementation and seems like pursuing the easy-to-use library based on its concise type classes hierarchy.

Q. What and how did you start learning Scala?

> I decided to learn Scala since I need a more productive language while keeping type-safety.
>
> First of all, Scala is less verbose than Java. Less code leads less complexity. 
This feature enable me to write, maintaining, read less code while enhancing my productivity.
>  
> Second, Scala has the amazing type system and many libraries like shapeless, cats and circe on the top of the type system 
> For example, quills provide compile time query syntax checking. This is hard to implement in other language like Java due to language limitation   

Q. What is a recent technical challenge you experienced while using Scala, and how did you solve it.

> TBD

Q. Talk about your preferred development environment. 

> I am currently working on OSX and using IntelliJ IDEA with VIM key map. 
I like ZSH and many terminal tools (e.g, tmux, peco) which boost my productivity.
I also like to save and share my aliases and shell configuration on github.

Q. What are your thoughts about the other JVM languages compared to Scala?

> I have not used Kotlin and other JVM languages heavily except Scala and Java. 
I think Kotlin is between Java and Scala. It has easy-to-use syntax but has limitation compared to Scala.
It would be great for light users who do not want to use advanced features like type classes, macros and so on.

Q. Do you think that the Scala language and community is mature enough?

> Definitely YES! The best thing of Scala is, IMO, Scala is backed by both in academia and industry
> Scala currently has many references in industry such as Spark and Akka 
> Also academic supports enable Scala to evolve and come up with its limitation. Dotty would be one of examples
